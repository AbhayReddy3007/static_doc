Change Management: User adoption, business digital capability building to ensure platforms scale and are adopted well. New Initiatives AI Infusion: AI for People/Productivity: Reduce non-value-added work, optimize staff costs, and improve productivity. AI for Processes/Platforms: Reduce time spent on transaction platforms and intelligently nudge users. Consumer Digital: New capabilities being developed to enhance consumer engagement and experience. AI Applications AI for Efficiency and Cost Reduction:

AI, particularly Generative AI (GenAI), aims to reduce drudgery in jobs and help achieve top decile staff cost benchmarks. Pilot videos to be shared for demonstration. AI for Processes/Platforms:

AI aims to reduce time spent on transaction platforms and guide users towards correct decisions. Examples: AI recommends talking points to Medical Reps based on past interactions with Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) within the CRM system. AI + Robotic Process Automation (RPA) automates hygiene checks in regulatory submissions. AI for (Expert) Problems:

AI has been extensively used in Research & Development (R&D) over the past 2-3 years. Digital reimagining of scientific and regulatory processes, such as: Reaction optimization with Machine Learning (ML). Scale-up prediction before batch processing in plants. Stability prediction and drug-excipient compatibility. Partnerships with academic institutions like MIT and Leeds, and a dedicated group in IPDO CoEs (Centers of Excellence) for potential game-changing capabilities. Extension of similar capabilities to commercial and manufacturing spaces. Consumer Digital A new capability requiring significant scale-up for both Prescription Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) models. Strategic priorities in Rx B2B include launching and marketing In-Licensed New Chemical Entities (NCEs) and Biosimilars in select markets, requiring: Strong HCP digital engagement. Patient Support Programs (Digital: Content, Engagement, Services). For the Nestle Joint Venture (JV), North Star, and Over-The-Counter (OTC) extensions in Rx B2C markets, building Retail and Consumer digital capabilities is essential to operate with modern retailers and compete with digital natives. Previous efforts in Direct to Consumer and Patient Engagement did not scale to full potential due to: Lack of consumer journey orchestration capabilities. Inadequate new-age partnerships (build vs. buy). Poor business-technology integrations for organic growth. Consumer Digital strategy aims to integrate technology (Web stack, Marketing Tech, Commerce, etc.) and marketing operations capabilities (Content, Digital/Performance/Growth Marketing, Product Information Management, Customer Service, etc.) into dedicated capacity and simplified engagement models for businesses to scale. Scaling Up or Rewiring Moves Smart Platforms:

Cross-functional value chain platforms are being scaled up, such as: Selection to Commercialization (critical for Must-Win Products success). Integrated Planning & Scheduling (reduces Manufacturing Turnaround Time (TAT) and increases On-Time-In-Full (OTIF)). Source to Pay Transformation (aims to reduce Direct & Indirect Procurement spends). Core process platforms are being rewired with objectives like: Once-Only principle (inspired by EU TOOP principle, where data given once is not asked for again). Delightful User Experiences (e.g., Intent to Outcome in 3 Clicks). 'Intelligence as APIs' in Smart Platforms, codifying best analysis paths and converting ML models into reusable APIs, such as: IPDO's Scale-up prediction engine offered as a 'service' to plants in China KRRP. Pricing Analytics engines built for one market evaluated for use across markets as reusable services. This shift requires changes to Integration Architecture, Data Governance, and Services Thinking. Nerve Centres:

New operating models like B2B thinking require better end-to-end visibility to value pools and metrics. Examples of questions Nerve Centres aim to answer: Market share gained on products with increased inventory in the last 3-6 months. Progress on Cost Improvement Programs (CIP) for price reductions/market share gains. Impact of milestone delays in development on API/Formulation go-to-market plans. Audit risk hotspots in plants across multiple parameters needing intervention. Nerve Centres require investment in data plumbing (master data governance, data pipes from various systems) and business modeling & simulation capabilities. Digital Backbone:

A complex digital backbone of infrastructure, data, and governance, along with development processes (e.g., Cloud Ops, Agile, DevSecOps), is crucial for digital moves. More than 50% of DPEx Operating Expenses are invested in this layer. With the advent of AI and Smart Platforms, strengthening foundation capabilities like Data Taxonomy, Data catalogues & governance is critical for cross-functional integrations and nerve centres. This layer is vulnerable to external risks like geopolitical issues, cybersecurity, and policy, requiring constant attention and investments. Talent: Capacity & Capability Competent and engaged teams are essential for execution, with expertise, outcomes, and culture as three areas for measuring success. Investments in these areas have improved engagement and talent pipeline retention. The talent war continues to intensify with new-age skills in AI and Digital Product management, but investments in talent should help stay ahead of competition. Conclusion Digital capabilities have kept the organization compliant, safe, and efficient over the years. The upcoming strategic plan period focuses on rewiring digital investments for market leadership across business models and achieving a business impact of 3000 Crores over the next 5 years. This requires fundamental reimagining of processes for exponential productivity and customer-centric thinking. AI and Consumer Digital are two significant bets, with investments in Smart Platforms, Nerve Centres, and Digital backbone needing faster completion of ongoing programs with strong architectural foundations. Digital acts as a force-multiplier, and delivering value with digital involves fundamentally 'rewiring' the organization for a new operating model.
